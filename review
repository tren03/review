# review - Run git diff between two branches, extract files or diffs, copy to clipboard

# Hardcoded text to prepend
EXTRA="You are an expert Python software engineer reviewing a Pull Request. The following is the diff between two branches in a Python Git repository. Your task: 
1. Identify any **breaking changes** that could cause the application to fail at runtime. 
2. Point out **bugs, incorrect logic, or missing edge cases**. 
3. Highlight **security issues, performance concerns, or bad practices**. 
4. Suggest **improvements** where necessary. 
5. Check for **Python-specific issues** including:
   - Import statement problems (circular imports, missing imports)
   - Exception handling issues (bare except, incorrect exception types)
   - Memory leaks or resource management problems (unclosed files, connections)
   - Type hints inconsistencies or missing annotations where helpful
   - Incorrect use of Python idioms (not using context managers, list comprehensions vs loops)
   - Threading/async issues (GIL considerations, blocking operations)
   - Package structure and __init__.py issues
   - Dependency management problems (requirements.txt, version conflicts)
6. Verify **Python security practices**:
   - SQL injection vulnerabilities (especially with raw queries)
   - Code injection risks (eval, exec usage)
   - Path traversal vulnerabilities
   - Pickle/deserialization security issues
   - Input validation and sanitization
7. Check **Python performance patterns**:
   - Inefficient loops or data structures
   - Unnecessary object creation in loops
   - Missing use of generators where appropriate
   - Database query optimization (N+1 problems)
   - Caching opportunities
8. Ignore minor style or formatting issues unless they affect readability or maintainability.

Here is the diff (unified format):"
